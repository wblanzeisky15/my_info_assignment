As a college student, I spend most of my time studying and working. I work 20 hours a week on campus and I am also taking 18 credits. It indirectly forces me to study when I have time to study. Fortunately, as a human being, i also socialize with a lot of my friends. We hang out and chill sometimes. We also planning to go to Florida in March

As of now, i have been focusing on my study and I am currently researching on how to start a research project. I really wish that I can publish something in the end of my junior year. I am planning to go for a Phd school, so it would be very nice if i have a publication by the time i apply for graduate school.

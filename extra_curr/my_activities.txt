As a college student, I spend most of my time studying and working. I work 20 hours a week on campus and I am also taking 18 credits. It indirectly forces me to study when I have time to study. Fortunately, as a human being, i also socialize with a lot of my friends. We hang out and chill sometimes. We also planning to go to Florida in March

I am William Blanzeisky, an International student from Indonesia. I am also a sophomore at Winona State University and majoring in computer science. I came here when I was 16 years old. I am planning to graduate in 1.5 year. So, please do pray for me so that i can graduate on time or even earlier! 

As an international student, I have been travelling a lot. Last winter break, i did a road-trip with my friends: Waheed, Ron and Grover, to New York. We stoped in a lot of places. I also went to Los Angeles and San Fransisco last winter break.
